# Fractals

![An image of a filled Julia set](imgs/julia_set_screenshot_2.png)

This GH repository contains code used to generate the fractal images that can be found in my blog posts about [the Mandelbrot set](https://mathspp.com/blog/fractals-and-mandelbrot-set) and [the filled Julia Set](https://mathspp.com/blog/julia-set).

For the Mandelbrot sets generated with `mandelbrotConstant` and `mandelbrotEvolutive`, clicking the screen will zoom in the fractal on that point.
Note that the fractal of `mandelbrotEvolutive` becomes better than the one of `mandelbrotConstant` as you zoom in.

For the Julia set generated with `juliaSet`, clicking a point in the complex plane will create its filled Julia set
Pressing spacebar presents the user with the initial white screen with the 2 axis; Pressing the left arrow goes back to previous filled Julia sets, while pressing the right arrow goes forward again.

The .rar folders contain windows executables for the Python scripts of the same name;
